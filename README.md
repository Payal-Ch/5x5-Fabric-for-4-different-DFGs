# 5x5-Fabric-for-4-different-DFGs
This project implements a reconfigurable 5x5 computational fabric to map four distinct Data Flow Graphs (DFGs). It features homogeneous Computational Units (CUs) with Pass and NOOP operations, 4-bit datawidth support, and a heterogeneous interconnect with mirroring, optimizing flexibility and performance across DFGs.
